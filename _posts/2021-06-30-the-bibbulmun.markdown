The Bibbulmun Track is one of the worldâ€™s great long distance walk trails, stretching 1000km from Kalamunda in the Perth Hills, to Albany on the south coast, winding through the heart of the scenic South West of Western Australia. If you want to know more then I'd encourage you to go to the Bibbulmun website: [https://www.bibbulmuntrack.org.au/](https://www.bibbulmuntrack.org.au/)
